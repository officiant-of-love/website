We were so impressed with the beautiful and meaningful ceremony. Helena  perfectly captured our love story and our hopes and dreams for the future. We also appreciate her personal touches, one of our favorite parts is the "honoring of our loved ones" who weren't able to be with us on that special day. We are so grateful for her role in our wedding day. It was truly magical, and we will never forget it`,

We had planned and replanned our wedding several times due to covid and finally decided to elope. Helena accommodated our wedding date on short notice and still provided us with full service options and ceremony customization. We greatly appreciated the ease of communication with Helena through text, phone calls, and email. Helena answered all of our questions about the marriage license process.  Helena was such a pleasure to speak with and be in her presence on our special day. We truly felt her sincerity and genuine love for the relationships she is officiating. Thank you Helena!",

We were super bummed; however, I promised my fiancÃ© that I would plan a surprise ceremony, something small and sweet to make up for the cancellation. Upon doing research, I came across Minister Helena and called her late at night to promptly start planning our ceremony with a specific date in mind. She was so detailed and involved, she sent over passages and vows that we would be able to choose from and worked closely with me to plan the ceremony from start to finish. She was flexible and considerate about our location and how it may tie in with our story. My now husband and I are so pleased that we chose someone as kind and thoughtful as Minister Helena to elope us. She will forever be part of our union. Thank you, a million times. Always with love from Hagop and me.",
